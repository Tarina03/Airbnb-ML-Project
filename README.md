## Overview

The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze Airbnb listing datasets to uncover meaningful patterns.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict rental prices.
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

This project was developed as part of a machine learning lab exercise to strengthen practical skills in working with real-world data.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Identify key patterns and trends in the data.
  - Handle missing values and outliers.

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Random Forest

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-squared (R²)

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
  - Grid Search for optimal model parameters.

## Results

The Random Forest achieved the best performance with the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):**  \0.145
- **R-squared (R²):**  0.99

These results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict rental prices based on the input features.
